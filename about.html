        <p>
          Hi! I'm Nur Aisyah Sofea binti Anuar Russhahir, or you can call me Sofea. I'm a passionate digital creator from Melaka, Malaysia. I specialize in website design and digital content creation.<br>
          
          My journey began when I started experimenting with poster designs for school events. That quickly grew into my interest in poster and graphic design. I’m someone who loves to learn, experiment, and grow. My mission is to create digital experiences that are not only beautiful but also accessible, and purposeful. I enjoy turning complex ideas into clean and user-friendly designs that make a difference.<br>
          
          Working with me means collaborating with someone who values clear communication, consistency, and creative energy. I love connecting with people and believe that the best work comes from a space of trust and shared passion.If you're looking for someone to help bring your ideas to life or just want to chat about design, tech, or creativity feel free to reach out.
